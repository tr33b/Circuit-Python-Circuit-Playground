Coding Challenge:
While - User, Random Numbers, Guessing, NeoPixels

Starting with this random number generating code,
create a guessing game, where you ask the user for a
random number, and then try to guess it randomly in less
than 5 tries.

pseudocode:
 - Ask the user for a number from 1 and 10
 - Test that the number is 1-10
 - Turn that NeoPixlel Green
 - Setup a while loop to run only 5 times with a
   loop count variable
 - inside the while loop test if the random
   number is == the user number
   - if the random number matches the user number
     - Turn that NeoPixlel Blue
     - use the "break" command to break out of the loop 
   - else
     - turn that NeoPixel Red
     - Increment the loop count variable
 - When the while loop ends (either after 5 loops or the break)
   - If the loop counter is less that 5 times, then the computer
     wins. print('I Win, I guessed your number in',count,'tries')
   - Else, the user wins. print('You Win, I did not guess your
     number in', count, 'tries')

Expected Output: (Possible... It's a Random Number)
