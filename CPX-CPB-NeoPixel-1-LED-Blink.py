Blink example for boards with ONLY a NeoPixel LED (e.g. without a built-in red LED).
Includes QT Py and various Trinkeys.
Requires two libraries from the Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle.
Download the bundle from circuitpython.org/libraries and copy the
following files to your CIRCUITPY/lib folder:
* neopixel.mpy
* adafruit_pixelbuf.mpy
Once the libraries are copied, save this file as code.py to your CIRCUITPY
drive to run it.
